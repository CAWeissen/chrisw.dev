# Portfolio for Chris Weissenberger

This portfolio site utilizes a lot of technologies that I've wanted to try out but never got the chance to use while doing client work. I'll constantly be updating this as I explore new things!

As for the stack, the site is bundled with Snowpack and built with:
- React.js
- Styled Components
- A little bit of three.js (and react-three-fiber)
- Dark mode support

## Available Scripts
### yarn start

Runs the site in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits and any lint errors will show up in the console.

### yarn build

Builds a static copy of the site to the `build/` folder.
